  ## Usage instructions
  
  Once the application starts, train Rhasspy's model by accessing port `:12101` at you device's local IP address on the browser.
  
  After making sure you have a working audio input, access port `:80` to access the Web UI and track your mood.
  
  To create new mood logs, simply say "computer, I'm feeling {intensifier} {mood} today". After a few seconds, the new record will show up on the UI.
  
  To add support for new moods/intensifiers, as well as change how you interact with the mood tracker, go back to Rhasspy's UI and edit the configurations.
